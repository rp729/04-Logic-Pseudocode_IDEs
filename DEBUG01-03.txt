// This pseudocode is intended to describe

// computing the per day cost of your rent

// in a 30-day month


start
   
    input rent
   
    costPerDay = rent / 30
   
    output costPerDay
stop

//Corrected logical error on line 3. Changed 31 to 30.
//Corrected output on line 4 to reflect costPerDay rather than rent
